First open a shell on the container.

```shell
docker exec -ti my-container bash
```

Now we are going to completely wrack the container.

```shell
docker exec -ti new-container bash
# root@df202644ebae:/# rm -fr /lib
# root@df202644ebae:/# ls
# bash: /usr/bin/ls: No such file or directory
# exit
```

You probably now can't make ls, or anything of the sort. Exit the 
container and check it is still running.

```shell
docker ps
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
# df202644ebae   ubuntu    "bash"    15 minutes ago   Up 14 minutes             new-container
```

As expected container is up and running however any command will fail.

```shell
docker exec new-container ls
# OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: no such file or directory: unknown
docker exec new-container ps
# OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: no such file or directory: unknown
```

Check if this happens in a new container.

 ```shell
# Run a new container interactive with input/output redirect in detached mode -d
# this options will make the container run the bash process indefinetly
docker run -ti -d --name fixed-container ubuntu bash
#ab22e20978b9fc108a244f99584d6f2f1a9afd1b33386350632ddff278385922

docker ps -a
#CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
#ab22e20978b9   ubuntu    "bash"    8 seconds ago    Up 4 seconds              fixed-container
#df202644ebae   ubuntu    "bash"    18 minutes ago   Up 17 minutes             new-container

docker exec -ti fixed-container ls
#bin   dev  home  lib32	libx32	mnt  proc  run	 srv  tmp  var
#boot  etc  lib	 lib64	media	opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```

Finally, kill the dangling container.

```shell
docker rm -f new-container
```

We can also use `docker diff` to find what change of the current container with the original image.
A clever way to restore the content would be to create a new container from the same image and use `docker cp` to 
restore the missing directory/ies.
